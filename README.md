# Frequentist-diagonal-ordering

This matlab function serves to restructure an adjacency matrix so that as many "1" entries as possible are located on the first super diagonal of the new adjacency matrix. 

It is used as a follow-up procedure to the PC-stable algorithm to construct genetic maps. For more details, please refer to our paper entitled "The potential of probabilistic graphical models in genetic mapping".
